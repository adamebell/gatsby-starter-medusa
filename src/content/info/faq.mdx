## Retailers

<Expandable title={"Do you sell wholesale?"}>
  I do! I'd be happy to work with your store to get your game in stock. Take a look [the line sheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adamebell/gatsby-starter-medusa/main/src/images/linesheet.png) and shoot me an email at adamebellgames @ gmail.com with your order or any questions you might have.

## Orders

<Expandable title={"Where is my order?"}>
  If you've placed your order and it contains any pre-order items, it will be shipped when the pre-orders are available. Otherwise, I'll be putting it together as soon as I can and getting it in the mail! Sometimes, I'll need to print and fold the zines which adds a bit of time.

<Expandable title={"What payment methods do you accept?"}>
  Currently, my payment processor is Stripe. It should accept just about any credit card, but if for some reason you can't check out don't hesitate to reach out and we can figure out an alternate for you.

## About the site

<Spacing size="sm" />

<Expandable title={"What platform are you using?"}>
  This website is built using Medusa, which is an open source alternative to Shopify. It took a bit of work to get set up properly but I wanted to limit the number of corporations I'm relying on to sell my games!
</Expandable>

<Expandable title={"What about your other games that I see on your itch page?"}>
  I wanted to get the site up and running with what I think of as my flagship games, and then work through the others to see what I can offer. More games will be added in the future for sure!
</Expandable>

<Expandable title={"Will you use this site to crowdfund a future game"}>
  I will! One of the benefits of this being open source is that I should be able to extend it in any way I'm technically capable of. I'm hoping to run an experimental crowdfunding campaign on here in the future, so join the newsletter (tinyletter.com/adamebell) to keep up with the latest news!
